# "environment" {
  type        = string
  default     = "dev"
  description = "Environment to deploy"
}

The purpose of this code block is to define a Terraform variable named "environment" with a
variable "region" {
  description = "AWS region"
  type        = string
}

# "environment" {
  type        = "string"
  default     = "prod"
  description = "The environment to deploy to"
}

The code block creates a variable named "environment" with a type of


variable "instance_type" {
  description = "Type of EC2 instance to provision"
  type        = string
}

# "environment" {
  default = "dev"
}

This Terraform code block defines a variable called "environment" with a default value of "dev". This variable can be used in other parts of the Terraform configuration to specify


variable "instance_name" {
  description = "EC2 instance name"
  type        = string
}
